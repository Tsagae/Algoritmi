# Goalgo(rithms and data structures)

Implementation of various algorithms and data structures in golang

Now reworked with generics and interfaces!

## Data Structures

- Binary Tree

- Stack
- Queue
- Priority Queue (Heap)
- Set (Implemented with a map)
- Graph (Directed and Undirected)

## Algorithms

- Sorting
    - Selection sort
    - Insertion sort
    - Bubble sort
    - Merge sort
    - Heap sort
    - quicksort

- Search
    - BFS
    - DFS

- Pathfinding
    - Dijkstra

- Minimum Spanning Tree
    - Prim
